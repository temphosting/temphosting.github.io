Libdlibxx is a C++11 library that I have been writing to allow easy
loading of dynamic libraries and typesafe lookup of functions. The
source code can be found at [https://github.com/mrenaud92/libdlibxx]
and has been packaged for Arch Linux and can be found in the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).
